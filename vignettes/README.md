### The vignettes folder

The `vignettes` folder contains dynamic notebooks, i.e. R markdown files which act as the report submission for this course. 
Included in the markdown files are the initial set-up of the projects and analysis required to complete the projects. 
The folder also contains html files, which allow visual easy access of the project report without having to re-knit the markdown file. 

The markdown and html files `Phenology_Modelling` contain the final report for the Phenology Modelling part of the course and
the files named `Spatial_Upscaling` contain the reports for the Spatial Upscaling part.
