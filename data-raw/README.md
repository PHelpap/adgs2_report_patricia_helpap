### The data-raw folder

The `data-raw` folder contains, as the name suggests, raw data and the scripts
to download and pre-process the data. No raw data is needed for this project, but intermittent results may want to be saved here if users have a small computer memory, e.g. in the `Phenology Modelling` project.
