#Submission folder for AGDSII - Patricia Helpap
This is a project repository for the course `Applied Geodata Science II` at UniBern. 
Included are two project submissions, namely for `Phenology Modelling` and `Spatial Upscaling`.

## Structure

### The R folder

The `R` folder contains R functions that would otherwise clutter the markdown files. 


### The data-raw folder

The `data-raw` folder contains, as the name suggests, raw data and the scripts
to download and pre-process the data. This is data which requires significant
pre-processing to be of use in analysis. In other words, this data is not 
analysis ready (within the context of the project).


### The data folder

The `data` folder contains analysis ready data. This is data which you can use,
as is. 

### The images folder

The `images` folder contains images that are used in markdown files for visualisation of used data. 

### The vignettes folder

The `vignettes` folder contains dynamic notebooks, i.e. R markdown files which act as the report submission for this course. 
Included in the markdown files are the initial set-up of the projects and analysis required to complete the projects. 
The folder also contains html files, which allow visual easy access of the project report without having to re-knit the markdown file. 

## Submission of projects
The project reports for `Phenology Modelling` and `Spatial Upscaling` parts of the course can be found in the vignettes folder. 
The submission for the `Land Cover Classification` was done as a pull request to the geco-github under the name PHelpap.
